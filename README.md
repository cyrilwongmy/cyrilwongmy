# 👋 Hi, I'm Mingyan Wang

I’m currently working on **Query Service** at **Salesforce Inc.**  
As a backend software engineer, I have a deep understanding of **Java**, **JDK/JVM internals**, **MySQL**, and **Kafka** — from design principles to low-level implementation details.  
I enjoy building distributed systems, optimizing performance, and exploring database and systems internals.

### 🧠 Personal Project Highlights

| Project | Description |
|:--|:--|
| [**mini-lm**](https://github.com/cyrilwongmy/mini-lm) | Built a Mini-LM from scratch to deepen understanding of transformer internals — embeddings, multi-head attention, layer normalization, and positional encoding. |
| [**stitches**](https://github.com/cyrilwongmy/stitches) | A PyTorch-like educational deep learning framework with minimal CUDA support. |
| [**bustub-db**](https://github.com/cyrilwongmy/bustub-db) | Implemented core BusTub components — LRU-based buffer manager, concurrent B+ tree, and full query executor pipeline. Verified via Gradescope. |
| [**csapp-labs**](https://github.com/cyrilwongmy/csapp-labs) | Implemented CSAPP labs: multithreaded web proxy, malloc (implicit free list), and cache simulator optimizing cache locality. |
| [**xv6-os**](https://github.com/cyrilwongmy/xv6-os) | Core xv6 OS labs: multi-level page tables, copy-on-write fork, user-level threading, lazy allocation, and concurrent buffer cache with buffer steal. |
| [**VMaiL**](https://github.com/cyrilwongmy/Vmail) | A hearing and speaking email app helping blind users access and send emails via voice. |
